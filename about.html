        <h3>PTSD</h3>
        <p>While post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is not exclusive to the military and can affect anyone who has experienced any type of trauma, veterans experience a higher rate of PTSD than the general population.[1] Yet, veterans often seek help less frequently because they donâ€™t want to be seen as weak or be treated differently.
        Additionally, some military leaders also believe that the term "disorder" makes suffering service members averse to seeking help, and they've tried to have it renamed post-traumatic stress injury, which would help reduce the stigma associated with "disorder."</p>
